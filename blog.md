## Introduction
This blog aims to describe our efforts into reproducing the paper “Hierarchical Image Classification using Entailment Cone Embeddings”. 
This paper discusses methods to leverage information about the semantic hierarchy embedded in class labels to boost image classification performance.  
INHOUD  
- Some info about the paper. CCN baselines and embedded methods. 

- Explanation that we want to reproduce parts of Table 2 (MC, baseline and one of the embedded methods; HC) with their data. Afterwards run the same code with our own hierarchical dataset from tiny imagenet. 

## Understanding/running the code
### Original code
The paper is provided with code, which is written in Pytorch. The paper itself describes little about steps followed to achieve the desired results, and the authors provide little information on how to use their code and dataset. This chapter will first provide some insights in the code and which parts are needed to reproduce the results that we want to achieve. Afterwards practical steps to run the code are explained. The reproduced paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03459.   
INHOUD  
- Uitleg over de code en wat we precies willen reproduceren  
- Praktische stappen om de code te runnen
